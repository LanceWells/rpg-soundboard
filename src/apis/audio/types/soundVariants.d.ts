   * be played. If pressed again, a new effect will be chosen and will overlap the original sound.

   * Effects that are played this way will also have a random pitch adjustment, which adds variety
   * to the output sound effect.

   * 3 effects, and when pressed, one sound would be chosen at random with a variable pitch. This
   * allows the user to rapidly press the button, getting a unique sound each time.
